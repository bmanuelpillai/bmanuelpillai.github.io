  <h3>New tools</h3>
  <div class="path-option">
    <p>Many times switching form a tool you are comfortable with to something new can feel overwhelming. You'll feel
      unproductive and frustrated, but if you plan on coding in the long-term then this initial time spent will have
      huge benefits to you.</p>

  <h3>Why Learn VScode</h3>
  <div class="path-option">
    <p>VScode is the industry standard code editor, and for good reason. It is super fast, lightweight, and is highly
      customizable. Rstudio is great for R, but if you ever want to branch off and learn a new coding language, VScode
      will set you up perfectly for this</p>

  <h3>Why Learn VIMmotions</h3>
  <div class="path-option">
    <p>Learn VIMotions at first is very tough, despite how intuitive the controls are. It will likely tank your
      productivity
      for a bit until you get comfortable. One common argument that people have about why to learn VIM is that it will
      make you a faster programmer. I would argue that the best reason to learn VIM is that it reduces the amount of
      time between when an idea pops into your mind and when you fingers can start to type it out.</p>
