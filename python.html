  <h3>Going From R to Python</h3>
  <div>
    <p>R is great but there are many packages that python has that R does not, especially when it comes to machine
      learning
      (scikit learn, PyTorch, etc.).

      One the biggest sticking points I experienced from going from R to python is managing virtual environments and
      dependencies. In R a lot of this is done behind the scenes and you often do not have to worry about using an
      explicit
      package version for your code. Although in Python it is important to download specific versions of your
      dependencies for
      each project.

      One method I really like it using poetry environments.</p>

  <!-- Install -->
  <div>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Download <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python</a> onto your computer</li>
      <li>You want to get a <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/" target="_blank">package manager
        </a>for Python on your computer</li>
      <li>Follow these instructions to get <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/" target="_blank">Poetry</a> on your
        computer</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- General Workflow using Poetry-->
  <div>
    <h3>General Workflow using Poetry</h3>
    <pre>
  # set up poetry and virtual environment for your repo
  poetry init
  poetry lock
  poetry env activate
  source .venv/bin/activate
  # this should create a poetry.toml file and a lock file

  # Add packages to your poetry environment
  poetry add
  poetry update
  </pre>
    <p>Use pyenv if you need to use a different version of python than the one that is on your system.</p>
