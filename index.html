  <h2>The Motivation to Learn to Code as a Researcher</h2>
  <h3>The big picture when it comes to coding as a scientist:</h3>
  <p>When you first start to program it can feel really overwhelming. You aren't comfortable with the language, you have
    to look up everything before you can implement what you want, and you'll more experienced programmers doing things a
    lot faster. It can be feel really overwheling, but reassured this will be the hardest part of your programming
    journey Once you gain experience and confidence as a programmer, you will
    feel like you can tackle any problem.</p>

<h2>One Video I really like about Scientists Learning to Code</h2>

  <h2>Why Coding is Fun</h2>
  <p>Coming from a STEM background one of my favorite parts about programming is how you get instant feedback from running your code. Either your code runs or you get an error message. Everytime your code runs you get a feeling of accomplishment that drives you over come the next bug in your code. Everytime you squash a bug in your code you develop your skillset in diagnosing new the next bug.</p>
  <p>I think coding is especially fun for scientists because it isn't our main job. We use code as a tool to answer the questions that interest us</p>
