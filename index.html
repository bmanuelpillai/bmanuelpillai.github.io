 <h2>The Motivation to Learn to Code as a Researcher</h2>
<p>The big picture when it comes to coding as a scientist:</p>
<p>Something about getting layers deep into coding feels like peeling an
onion. It often feels overwhelming, and you want to cry. Wrong mindset.
Think of it like eating a cake, where each layer may have a different
flavor, and you might like some parts more than others. Once you gain experience and confidence as a programmer, you will
feel like you can tackle any problem.</p>

<p>One video I really like about scientists and coding:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku0KGMabyYA" target="_blank">
How to learn programming - Advice for scientists | Clara Sousa-Silva and Lex Fridman - YouTube
</a></p>

<p>Something about how coding is like Minecraft: At the start, you struggle to
stay alive, but after a while, you get really good, and some tasks, like getting
food, become automatic.</p>
