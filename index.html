  <h2>The Motivation to Learn to Code as a Researcher</h2>
  <h3>The start is the hardest part</h3>
  <p>When you first start to program it can feel really overwhelming. You aren't comfortable with the language, you have to look up everything before you can do what you want. You'll see more experienced programmers doing things a lot faster and in ways you've never seen before. It can be feel really overwhelming, but rest assured this will be
  the hardest part of your programming journey. Once you gain experience and confidence as a programmer, you will feel like you can tackle any problem.</p>

  <h2>How Scientists Should Approach Coding</h2>

 <h2>Why Coding is Fun</h2>
  <p>Coming from a STEM background one of my favorite parts about programming is how you get instant feedback from
    running your code. Either your code runs or you get an error message. Every time your code runs you get a feeling of
    accomplishment that drives you to over come the next bug in your code. Every time you squash a bug in your code, you improve your ability to diagnose and fix the next one.
</p>
  <p>One of my favorite parts of coding is the community of developers and researchers that are there to support you with their online material. You can look at other people's projects or online tutorials for inspiration. Most importantly, you learn by doing so pick projects you enjoy doing.</p>
  <h2>Forest vs. Trees</h2>
  <p>Don't mistake the forest for the trees. I think coding is especially fun for scientists because it isn't our main job. We use code as a tool to answer the
    questions that interest us, but our goal is not make the most optimized or well-written. You may happen to become
    really good at coding as a byproduct of tackling your research questions, coding is just a mean to reach that goal.
  Write code first, then optimize it later if needed. Now, that is not to say that the code shouldn't be readable -- it
  should still be well documented so that others can work on it too.</p>

  <p>I include a lot of tools that make coding a lot easier and fun, but when you are first starting focus on getting
    the basics down. This comes with time and practice. I recommend following one course and then focusing most of your time on projects.</p>
