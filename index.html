  <h2>The Motivation to Learn to Code as a Researcher</h2>
  <p>The big picture when it comes to coding as a scientist:</p>
  <p>When you first start to program it can feel really overwhelming. You aren't comfortable with the language, you have
    to look up everything before you can implement what you want, and you'll more experienced programmers doing things a
    lot faster. It can be feel really overwheling, but reassured this will be the hardest part of your programming
    journey Once you gain experience and confidence as a programmer, you will
    feel like you can tackle any problem.</p>

  <p><b>One video I really like about scientists and coding:</b>

      How to learn programming - Advice for scientists | Clara Sousa-Silva and Lex Fridman - YouTube

  </p>

  <h3>My analogy on coding</h3>
  <p>Something about how coding is like Minecraft: At the start, you struggle to
    stay alive, but after a while, you get really good, and some tasks, like getting
    food, become automatic.</p>
