  <h2>The Motivation to Learn to Code as a Researcher</h2>
  <h3>The start is the hardest part</h3>
  <p>When you first start to program it can feel really overwhelming. You aren't comfortable with the language, you have
    to look up everything before you can implement what you want. You'll more experienced programmers doing things a
    lot faster and in ways you've never seen before. It can be feel really overwheling, but rest assured this will be the hardest part of your programming
    journey. Once you gain experience and confidence as a programmer, you will
    feel like you can tackle any problem.</p>

<h2>One Video I really like about Scientists Learning to Code</h2>

  <h2>Why Coding is Fun</h2>
  <p>Coming from a STEM background one of my favorite parts about programming is how you get instant feedback from running your code. Either your code runs or you get an error message. Everytime your code runs you get a feeling of accomplishment that drives you over come the next bug in your code. Everytime you squash a bug in your code you develop your skillset in diagnosing new the next bug.</p>
  <h2>Keep the main thing the main thing</h2>
  <p>I think coding is especially fun for scientists because it isn't our main job. We use code as a tool to answer the questions that interest us, but our goal is not make the most optimized or well-written. You may happen to become really good at coding as a byproduct of tackling your research questions, coding is just a mean to reach that goal. If you always write perfect code that means you didn't spent enough time doing good science.</p>

  <p>I include a lot of tools that make coding a lot easier and fun, but when you are first starting focus on getting the basics down.</p>
